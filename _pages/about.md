# Learn about cats

Hello, young cat enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹



I'm excited to share with you about cats.

 **Species:** Mammals

 **Diet:** Carnivores 

 **Habitat:** Adaptable 

Cats are playful and independent pets. They have sharp senses and can be both active and calm.
## What to Expect

Cats are fun buddies that bring both playful and quiet times to your home. They like doing things on their own but also love being close to you. Cats have sharp senses, so they're always aware of what's going on. Be ready for some grooming and moments of them being super active, adding lots of joy and fun to your everyday life with these adorable cats.
